## How to play

Keys q and w
Increase or decrease the picture size

Keys a and s
Increase or decrease the cirle pointer size

In the pointer you'll get the x and y coords, and the number of points included in the circle (a lot!!!)

Click on the player eyes (zoom the img for high precision) and move the mouse to find the best coords for the hidden ball. 
If you want to reset the points/lines refresh the page.

## Hot to change the picture
I' ll update the img when i decide to play. 
You could fork the repo, get the img url from the website and replace the url in the index.html. Easy
