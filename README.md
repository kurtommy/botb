## How to play

Keys q and w
Increase or decrease the img size

Keys a and s
Increase or decrease the cirle pointer size

In the pointer you'll get the x and y coodrs, and the number of points included in the circle (a lot!!!)

Click on the player eyes (zoom the img for high precision) and move the mouse to find the best coords for the hidden ball. 
If you want to reset the points/lines refresh the page.
